6. Differentiate between statically typed and Dynmically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
 - In statically typed programming language, type checking occurs at compile time(the period when programming code is converted to machine code), while type checking occurs at runtime(period of time when the program is running and usually occurs after compile time) for dynamically typed programming language.
 - It is reuquired to explictly state the data type of each variable when the variable is declared in statically typed programming language while this isn't required for dynamically typed programming language.
 -  In statically typed programming language, errors are detected eariler as they halt the compliation process until they are rectified(because this occurs at the compile time), thereby making programs perform better at exceution time as type checking has been completed. On the otherhand, errors are detected later during runtime in the dynamically typed programming language.
 - Variable assignments are static and cannot be changed in statically typed programming language while variable asignments are dynamic and can be altered in dynamically typed programming language.
 - Examples of languages in statically typed programming language are Java, C, C++, Haskell, Scala, Fortran, Go, Pascal, Swift and C#.
 - Examples of languages in dynamically typed programming language are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua and Tcl.

 7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types 'null' and 'undefined&nbsp';
 - null is a data typeof 'object' that means an empty or non-existent value, it explictly means nothing. 
 - Undefined is a data typeof 'Undefined' that means a variable has been declared but it has no value yet.
